						SMITE has 6 different casual gamemodes and 3 competetive ones.<br>
						All the 6 gamemodes are:
						<ul>
						<li>Conquest (5v5 3 lanes)</li><br>	
						<li>Arena (1 arena 5v5)</li><br>
						<li>Joust (3v3 1 lane)</li><br>
						<li>Clash (5v5 2 lanes)</li><br>
						<li>Siege (4v4 2 lanes)</li><br>
						<li> GOTW (rotating random gamemode)</li><br>
						</ul><br>
						
					Conquest: Conquest is the most 'normal' gamemode across MOBA's, a 5v5 in 3 lanes and a jungle.<br>
					Arena: Arena is the most casual gamemode in SMITE, simply because its not in the competetive scene and allround fun to play with friends.<br>
					Joust: Joust is a 3v3 gamemode with 1 lane, its mostly played by parties of 3 friends trying to have fun. This gamemode is also in the competetive scene.<br>
					Clash: Clash is a more competetively played gamemode across SMITE, its a fast paced, high pressure gamemode for people to play in. Not for everyone<br>
					Siege: Siege is a not so much played gamemode, but still a fun one to play with friends. It's 4v4 in 2 lanes and for really casual players.<br>
					GOTW: GOTW stands for Game Of The Week and is a rotating fun gamemode to try new, random modes given to or created by the SMITE community.<br>
