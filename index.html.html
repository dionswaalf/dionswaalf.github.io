					<h3><strong>SMITE is a first person MOBA where you fight with your teammates against 5 enemies.<br>
						The objective of the game is to break all enemy defences and killing their titan by attacking it.<br>
						The defences used in the main gamemode are 6 towers, 2 in their own lanes, 3 phoenixes and 1 titan.<br>
						There are 3 lanes in the main gamemode names Conquest, left lane, right lane and middle lane with a jungle in the middle of all lanes.<br>
						There are 5 different classes in smite, each resembling a role and a lane, this all explained in the "Type of gods" menu.<br>
						At last, there are 6 different gamemodes in SMITE to vary the gamestyles and gaming experience.<br>
