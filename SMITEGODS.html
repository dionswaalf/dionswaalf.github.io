				<h3><strong>
				Guardians: Guardians are mostly seen in the support role, because they all have alot of CC (Crowd Control) such as stuns and roots. Some guardians also have healing abilities which helps the ADC to stay alive. Guardians are only viable for support since they have a low base damage.<br>
				Hunters: Hunters, also known as ADC's have a high allround damage output used to help the support lane in the duo lane. An ADC is suppose to have the highest damage output at the end of the game, after that mages, assasins and warriors.<br>
				Warriors: Warriors are a hybrid between a guardian and an ADC, they have a medium damage output throughout the game and are used to get objectives mid and late game to tank the damage, because of their HP (health points).<br>
				Mages: Mages are seen as a high damage output with a stun/root. Mages are sometimes compared to Guardians, because of their stun/root, but mages are actually the opposite damage and HP wise, guardians have high HP and low damage and mages have low HP and high damage.<br>
				Assasins: Assasins are very low HP gods with a high single target damage output. They can kill squishies (low HP gods) in 1 or 2 hits because of this. Assasins can kill easily, but are easily killed aswel.<br>
